# Orogram

An implementation of a 1D density estimation library that represents PDFs using piecewise linear functions.
The term _orogram_ is used to refer to any representation of a PDF with a piecewise linear function.
That may be read as _histogram_ where the _histo_ (poles, as in telephone poles) has been replaced with _oro_ (mountains, which are triangular when you're five).
